Hi there! I am Osman, a passionate **software engineer in Bonn**, father of two, husband, brother, and enthusiast of software development, blockchain, business innovation, and football.

## Professional Background

I'm a software engineer with extensive experience in translating business requirements and objectives into fully-realized solutions. I specialize in building **web applications**, services, and APIs with robust test coverage, carefully considered architectures, and empathy for the end-user.

### Domain-Driven Design and Agile Principles

As a proud practitioner of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** methodologies, I focus on creating bridges between business and tech specialists. I believe that the right approach to technical topics can open communication doors for business stakeholders, including C-level executives, leading to perfect solutions for their problems.

Following **Agile principles**, promoting **independent teams**, and practicing **Continuous Delivery** are integral to my work. Even if these practices can't be implemented from the start, they should be the direction to follow for building successful software products.

## Current Role

Currently, I'm living in Bonn, Germany, and working as a senior software engineer for [Studitemps](https://studitemps.de). At Studitemps, we focus on creating systems for student employment [temping](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/temping).

### Applying DDD and SCS at Studitemps

In Studitemps, we apply **DDD design principles** to distributed Self-contained Systems (SCS). This approach ensures that business and software speak the same language and helps avoid the pitfalls of large, unmaintainable monoliths.

## Technical Expertise

Lately, I have been enjoying working with **Elixir**, **Ruby**, and **JavaScript (JS)**. However, I am always open to learning new technologies that make sense for the project or team and match my interests.

I can fill any role required by the project, whether as a team member, leader, or mentor. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and share it with others.
