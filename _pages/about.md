Hi there! I am Osman, father of two, husband, brother, with a passion for software development but also for blockchain, business, innovation, football...

I'm also a software engineer with experience translating business requirements and objectives into fully-realized solutions. I build web applications, services, and APIs with robust test coverage, carefully considered architectures, and empathy for the end-user.

Proud practitioner of Domain Driven Design methodologies in day-to-day work. I tend to look for bridges between business and tech specialists and strongly believe, the right approach to technical topics is a communication door-opener for business stakeholders (including C-level). that leads to perfect solutions to their problems.

I believe that following *Agile principles*, *independent teams*, *Continuous Delivery* and  is the best way to build software products. If it is not possible to implement them from the start they should be a direction to follow.

Currenlly, I'm living in Bonn Germany and working as a senior software engineer for [Studitemps](https://studitemps.de) where we are building a system focused on student employment [temping](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/temping).

Here in Studitemps, we are trying to apply DDD design principles to distributed Self-contained Systems (SCS). The reasons behind this decision are to make sure businesses and software speak the same language, to avoid the problem of large monoliths that grow constantly and eventually become unmaintainable, etc...

Lately, I've been enjoying mostly using Elixir, Ruby, JS, however, I'm always open to learn new technologies if it makes sense for the project/team and/or matches my interest.

I'm able to fill any role required by the project, be it team member, leader or mentor. Always eager to expand knowledge and to share it with others.
